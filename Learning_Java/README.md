# Welcome to my Java Learning Repository   :love_you_gesture:

Here you can run each *.java* file using the following commands, for example we are running **QuickStart.java** file: 
- Make sure you have changed your folder to where the file is located using:
  
>>>```cd "File Address"```
- Now run the following:
>>> ```javac QuickStart.java && java QuickStart```
